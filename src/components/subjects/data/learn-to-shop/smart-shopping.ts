      title: "Comparing Products",
      type: "Interactive Activity",
      duration: "25 minutes",
      content: "This activity develops your skills for making thoughtful product comparisons before purchasing. You'll learn systematic approaches to evaluating similar products based on multiple factors: price, quality, features, durability, reviews, and warranties. The interactive exercises present sets of comparable products (like different brands of the same item) with detailed information about each. You'll use digital comparison tools to weigh the pros and cons, prioritize which aspects matter most for specific needs, and make informed selections. The activity includes practice reading product specifications, understanding customer reviews, and recognizing the difference between essential features and costly add-ons. Different scenarios emphasize different priorities—sometimes lowest price is best, while other situations might justify paying more for quality or specific features."
